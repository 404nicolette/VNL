# VNL Women's division perfomance per country analysis
The project aims to observe and analyse the statistical data of the recently concluded Volleyball Nations League (VNL) Womenâ€™s division.

The tournament finished with Italy bagging the gold, then Japan with the silver, and Poland with bronze.

I decided to study this data as the final standing went against what I initially predicted. Although, I would like to acknowledge that my 
prediction was not based on any statistical measure but rather on _baseless assumptions._.
